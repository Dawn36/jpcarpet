									<p> Jackie, Peter &amp; their crew at jp carpet cleaning are really wonderful. used them again this morning for a vacancy and the carpet came out beautifully. I also have to say - after dealing with numerous contractors for different jobs in our buildings - it's always a welcome surprise when a business answers their phone (or promptly returns calls), immediately emails an appointment confirmation, shows up when they are supposed to, does a great job, is friendly &amp; well priced. those are very difficult things to find in a company these days and i have to say that jp carpet cleaning checks all the boxes!  </p>

									<p> I just want to tell that we were so pleased with JP carpet cleaning floor care expert services which have exceeded our expectations. Cleaners arrived on time, they were professional and friendly. They have cleaned our 6 years old carpet and make it look like a  brand new. In addition, I really like the convenience of scheduling the appointment. We have hired JP carpet cleaning a few times, and the team of their professionals is always punctual. So it is a big shout out to Jackie and Peter for their work and wonderful services. We are very satisfied with the services of JP carpet cleaning provided during their visit. Our clean and fluffy carpet feels so soft under our feet. Thank you!  </p><div class="col-md-6 pt-0 col-xl-5 offset-xl-7">

									<p> They came out the same day.  Were very nice and had some good carpet cleaning tips. I spilled some red wine on a brand new area carpet and after trying to clean it myself decided it's better to get a professional out who can save the day. I had a 1-3pm appointment, but they called and asked if they could come at 930am. I was thrilled they were out so fast.  Since it was just a spot they were done in 10 minutes. Very happy indeed. </p><div class="col-md-6 pt-0 col-xl-5 offset-xl-7">

									<p>These folks did a great job on our bathroom tile grout, which was long overdue for attention. A good experience all the way around:
                </p><p>1. Peter responded quickly to my inquiry and had me send some information and pictures of my project so he could give a prompt estimate. 
                </p><p>2. Jackie and the crew showed up right on time for my appointment.
                </p><p>3. They cleaned the tile, the grout and the glass, then Peter removed grotty old caulking to replace/repair grouting where it was needed and reseal everything, leaving the bathroom looking great. 
                </p><p>4. They loved up on my dog and cat, too!
                </p><p>Really nice work all the way around. I'll be calling them again, because we've got more floors in need of love!  </p>

									<p> I just used JP for grout cleaning in a few of my bathrooms. They were incredibly easy to communicate with and flexible on making the appointment. They offered a very competitive rate and showed EXACTLY on time; on the dot which I truly appreciate. Jackie showed up with 2 other workers, had all of the equipment they needed and got the job done very quickly and swiftly. I have 2 bathroom floors and showers to be cleaned and scrubbed/grout cleaning. She could not have been more friendly, kind and helpful. She gave us a bunch of tips on what we can do to maintain and improve our surfaces and all in all they finished within an hour. Great small business, kind helpful and attentive people and do what they say they're going to do which is an unfortunately uncommon trend with household services! A++ and will definite use again and refer other friends to them! </p><div class="col-md-6 pt-0 col-xl-5 offset-xl-7">

									 <p>Just had my carpets cleaned by Jackie and her crew again. I've used their service for several years and am always happy with their work and the fair pricing. I've also had them refinish hardwood floors. Peter is very detail oriented and does a great job. I also appreciate that they arrive on time and are efficient (something I find lacking in many other service providers). I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them!</p>
